# Andrew's Terraform Code Examples

Documenting solutions to interesting Terraform problems.

## Requirements

Consider installing [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) if you want these code exmaples to "just work" for you.

# Examples

* [Dynamic Templatefile Rendering](./dynamic-template-output/README.md)
  * Keeping `templatefile()` function calls and the files themselves DRY — avoids writing variables twice, as input and output.
